    \Ac{AI} is one of the most promising mankind's inventions in recent history, and it already has a significant impact on our daily lives.
    %
    During the last decade \ac{NeSy} \ac{AI}, that aims to develop systems that integrate symbolic and sub-symbolic \ac{AI}, has gained increasing attention.
    %
    The exploitation of both symbolic and sub-symbolic aspects of \ac{AI} is crucial to develop systems that can overcome the limitations of the two paradigms.
    %
    Beyond all the possible research branches, \ac{SKI} and \ac{SKE} are two major areas that can have a key role in the development of intelligent systems.
    %
    At the writing of this thesis, we are experiencing a de facto Copernican revolution that is not limited to the \ac{AI} field but also involves the whole society: the advent of \acp{LLM}.

    This thesis focuses on \ac{NeSy} \ac{AI}, in particular on \ac{SKI}, \ac{SKE} and on the engineering of intelligent software systems.
    %
    First, we reconcile the most relevant definitions and concepts after a comprehensive overview of the background and the state of the art in the field of \ac{NeSy} \ac{AI},
    %
    We then identify the challenges associated with \ac{NeSy} \ac{AI} and how we can address them.
    %
    In particular, present original contributions in terms of methodologies, algorithms, and tools for \ac{SKI} and \ac{SKE} that enable us to further develop \ac{NeSy} \ac{AI} systems.
    %
    Finally, we discuss how to design intelligent systems that exploit the synergy between symbolic and sub-symbolic \ac{AI}, especially in critical domains such as fairness and healthcare.
    %
    Ultimately, we present intelligent systems that can autonomously learn.

\begin{acknowledgements} % this is optional
    %
    First and foremost, I would like to thank my parents, Barbara and Marcello, for their unconditional love and support.
    %
    Both of them thought me the importance of hard work and perseverance.
    %
    My dad made me passionate in science and technology, my mom the interest for history.
    %
    I thank my grandparents, Mirka, Franca and Marco, for their love and presence.
    %
    Without them all, I would have not started a Ph.D., at least, not here in Italy.
    %
    The disgusting lack of financial support from the Italian government for the scientific research has always been -- since the infamous Gentile's reform -- a curse for the development of the country.

    I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Andrea Omicini, for his knowledge, guidance, and support.
    %
    Beyond anything else, I really appreciated the freedom he gave me during my journey.
    %
    I thank my senior colleague, and de facto co-supervisor, prof. Giovanni Ciatto for his daily support and guidance especially during my first year as a research fellow and in the first year of my Ph.D.
