\begin{abstract}
    %
    \Ac{AI} represents one of humanity's most transformative technological advancements, with roots in the mid-20th century and a rapidly growing impact on society.
    %
    Over the past decade, the field of \ac{NeSy} \ac{AI}, which seeks to integrate \emph{symbolic} and \emph{sub-symbolic} approaches, has gained increasing prominence as a promising paradigm for building intelligent systems.
    %
    By combining the structured reasoning capabilities of symbolic \ac{AI} with the adaptability and scalability of sub-symbolic methods, \ac{NeSy} aims to overcome the inherent limitations of each paradigm, paving the way for more robust and interpretable \ac{AI} systems.

    Within \ac{NeSy}, two foundational areas of research are \ac{SKI} and \ac{SKE}, which provide the essential tools to design hybrid systems.
    %
    \Ac{SKI} focuses on injecting structured knowledge into sub-symbolic models, enabling them to leverage prior domain expertise.
    %
    \Ac{SKE}, on the other hand, facilitates the extraction of human-understandable knowledge from these models, bridging the gap between their internal representations and user interpretability.
    %
    Together, these methods offer a pathway toward developing systems that are explainable, reliable, and effective in dynamic, real-world scenarios.

    This thesis explores the challenges and opportunities of \ac{NeSy} \ac{AI}, with a particular focus on \ac{SKI},~\ac{SKE}, and their role in the engineering of intelligent systems.
    %
    After an overview of the background and state of the art, we identify key challenges in integrating symbolic and sub-symbolic paradigms.
    %
    We then present original contributions in the form of methodologies, algorithms, and tools designed to advance the capabilities of \ac{NeSy} systems.

    The advent of \acp{LLM} has further transformed the landscape of \ac{AI}, offering unprecedented capabilities for understanding and generating natural language.
    %
    This thesis investigates how \acp{LLM} can augment \ac{SKI} and \ac{SKE}, providing new avenues for designing systems that learn and adapt autonomously.
    %
    By leveraging these models, we demonstrate how hybrid approaches can address complex challenges, such as fairness and decision-making in healthcare, while ensuring interpretability and alignment with ethical principles.

    Finally, we discuss how these advancements align with the broader vision of \ac{NeSy}, while also contributing to the specific goal of this thesis: enabling the development of systems capable of fully autonomous learning.
    %
    These systems integrate the structured reasoning of symbolic \ac{AI} with the adaptability of sub-symbolic models and the transformative potential of \acp{LLM}, opening pathways toward more versatile and intelligent applications.
    %
    Such progress not only advances the field but also hints at the distant horizon of general AI, bringing us closer to a future where machines can learn, reason, and adapt autonomously.

    ``The work of each individual contributes to a totality, and so becomes an undying part of the totality.
    %
    That totality of human lives -- past and present and to come -- forms a tapestry that has been in existence now for many tens of thousands of years and has been growing more elaborate and, on the whole, more beautiful in all that time.
    %
    % Even the Spacers are an offshoot of the tapestry and they, too, add to the elaborateness and beauty of the pattern.
    %
    [\dots] An individual life is one thread in the tapestry and what is one thread compared to the whole?
    %
    Daneel, keep your mind fixed firmly on the tapestry and do not let the trailing off of a single thread affect you.''
