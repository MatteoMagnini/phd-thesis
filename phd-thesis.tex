\begin{abstract}
    %
    \Gls{AI} represents one of humanity's most transformative technological advancements, with roots in the midâ€‘20th century and rapidly growing societal impact.
    %
    Over the past decade, the field of \gls{NeSy} \gls{AI} -- which seeks to integrate \emph{symbolic} and \emph{sub-symbolic} approaches -- has gained increasing prominence as a promising paradigm for building intelligent systems.
    %
    By combining the structured reasoning capabilities of symbolic \gls{AI} with the adaptability and scalability of sub-symbolic methods, \gls{NeSy} aims to overcome the inherent limitations of each paradigm, paving the way for more robust and interpretable systems.

    Within this broad and multifaceted landscape, this thesis focuses on two complementary subfields of \gls{NeSy}: \gls{SKI} and \gls{SKE}.
    %
    These two areas, often seen as \emph{two sides of the same coin}, provide foundational mechanisms for the development of hybrid intelligent systems.
    %
    \Gls{SKI} enables the injection of structured domain knowledge into sub-symbolic models, guiding their behavior, improving generalization, and enhancing trustworthiness.
    %
    \Gls{SKE}, conversely, facilitates the extraction of symbolic, human-understandable information from these models, bridging the gap between opaque internal representations and interpretability.
    %
    Together, \gls{SKI} and \gls{SKE} form a synergistic loop: while \gls{SKI} influences learning by introducing external structure, \gls{SKE} enables inspection, verification, and refinement of that structure, contributing to the creation of systems that are explainable, reliable, and adaptable to real-world complexity.

    This thesis explores the challenges and opportunities of \gls{NeSy} \gls{AI}, with a particular focus on \gls{SKI}, \gls{SKE}, and their role in the engineering of intelligent systems.
    %
    After an overview of the background and state of the art, we identify key challenges in integrating symbolic and sub-symbolic paradigms.
    %
    We then present original contributions in the form of methodologies, algorithms, and tools designed to advance the capabilities of \gls{NeSy} systems.

    The advent of \glspl{LLM} has further transformed the landscape of \gls{AI}, offering unprecedented capabilities for understanding and generating natural language.
    %
    This thesis investigates how \glspl{LLM} can augment \gls{SKI} and \gls{SKE}, providing new avenues for designing systems that learn and adapt autonomously.
    %
    By leveraging these models, we demonstrate how hybrid approaches can address complex challenges -- such as fairness and decision-making in healthcare -- while ensuring interpretability and alignment with ethical principles.

    Finally, we discuss how these advancements align with the broader vision of \gls{NeSy}, while also contributing to the specific goal of this thesis: enabling the development of systems capable of fully autonomous learning.
    %
    These systems integrate the structured reasoning of symbolic \gls{AI}, the adaptability of sub-symbolic models, and the transformative potential of \glspl{LLM}, opening pathways toward more versatile and intelligent applications.
    %
    Such progress not only advances the field but also brings us closer to the distant horizon of general \gls{AI}, where machines can learn, reason, and adapt autonomously.

    ``The work of each individual contributes to a totality, and so becomes an undying part of the totality.
    %
    That totality of human lives -- past and present and to come -- forms a tapestry that has been in existence now for many tens of thousands of years and has been growing more elaborate and, on the whole, more beautiful in all that time.
    %
    % Even the Spacers are an offshoot of the tapestry and they, too, add to the elaborateness and beauty of the pattern.
    %
    [\dots] An individual life is one thread in the tapestry and what is one thread compared to the whole?
    %
    Daneel, keep your mind fixed firmly on the tapestry and do not let the trailing off of a single thread affect you.''
