  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter begins with a simple description language and reveals how a very small change in its expressiveness completely changes the sort of reasoning procedure it requires. It also considers the idea of languages in a more limited way than first-order logic (FOL) and examines what seems to happen as they are generalized to full FOL. To illustrate the tradeoff between expressiveness and tractability it begins by examining a very concrete case involving description logics and the subsumption task. It suggests that one way of dealing with the tradeoff is to allow very expressive languages, but to preserve tractability by doing a form of reasoning that is somehow less demanding. Researchers have proposed alternative logical systems with weaker notions of entailment that might be candidates for exploration of limited reasoning with expressive representation languages. The tradeoff between expressiveness and complexity is so fundamental to the understanding of knowledge representation and reasoning the chapter also concentrates on that issue and leaves aside the consideration of weak logics.}

  abstract = { In remote areas or regions with limited access to medical specialists, there is often a high reliance on telemedicine and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic tools. However, misdiagnoses or inadequate care may occur if the AI system lacks domain knowledge, failing to adhere to medical protocols. Despite the incredible research efforts applying AI in medicine, only a few models have been routinely adopted in medicine, due to issues related to trustworthiness. To address these concerns, Symbolic Knowledge Injection (SKI) has been proposed as a solution: it integrates domain-specific expertise into Machine Learning (ML) models, to improve their predictive capabilities. Despite their promising results in other fields, applicability of SKI in healthcare scenarios has not been thoroughly investigated, yet. Accordingly, in this study, we explore the applicability of a SKI method on medical datasets to evaluate: (i) how the predictive capabilities of ML models changes, (ii) their adherence to the medical protocols, and (iii) their robustness w.r.t. data degradation. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating data-driven models with established medical guidelines by improving different clinically relevant metrics. },

@article{EthicsLLMs-NatureDigitalMedicine2024,
  abstract = {With the introduction of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have received enormous attention in healthcare. Despite potential benefits, researchers have underscored various ethical implications. While individual instances have garnered attention, a systematic and comprehensive overview of practical applications currently researched and ethical issues connected to them is lacking. Against this background, this work maps the ethical landscape surrounding the current deployment of LLMs in medicine and healthcare through a systematic review. Electronic databases and preprint servers were queried using a comprehensive search strategy which generated 796 records. Studies were screened and extracted following a modified rapid review approach. Methodological quality was assessed using a hybrid approach. For 53 records, a meta-aggregative synthesis was performed. Four general fields of applications emerged showcasing a dynamic exploration phase. Advantages of using LLMs are attributed to their capacity in data analysis, information provisioning, support in decision-making or mitigating information loss and enhancing information accessibility. However, our study also identifies recurrent ethical concerns connected to fairness, bias, non-maleficence, transparency, and privacy. A distinctive concern is the tendency to produce harmful or convincing but inaccurate content. Calls for ethical guidance and human oversight are recurrent. We suggest that the ethical guidance debate should be reframed to focus on defining what constitutes acceptable human oversight across the spectrum of applications. This involves considering the diversity of settings, varying potentials for harm, and different acceptable thresholds for performance and certainty in healthcare. Additionally, critical inquiry is needed to evaluate the necessity and justification of LLMs'current experimental use.},
