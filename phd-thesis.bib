  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter begins with a simple description language and reveals how a very small change in its expressiveness completely changes the sort of reasoning procedure it requires. It also considers the idea of languages in a more limited way than first-order logic (FOL) and examines what seems to happen as they are generalized to full FOL. To illustrate the tradeoff between expressiveness and tractability it begins by examining a very concrete case involving description logics and the subsumption task. It suggests that one way of dealing with the tradeoff is to allow very expressive languages, but to preserve tractability by doing a form of reasoning that is somehow less demanding. Researchers have proposed alternative logical systems with weaker notions of entailment that might be candidates for exploration of limited reasoning with expressive representation languages. The tradeoff between expressiveness and complexity is so fundamental to the understanding of knowledge representation and reasoning the chapter also concentrates on that issue and leaves aside the consideration of weak logics.}

  abstract = { In remote areas or regions with limited access to medical specialists, there is often a high reliance on telemedicine and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic tools. However, misdiagnoses or inadequate care may occur if the AI system lacks domain knowledge, failing to adhere to medical protocols. Despite the incredible research efforts applying AI in medicine, only a few models have been routinely adopted in medicine, due to issues related to trustworthiness. To address these concerns, Symbolic Knowledge Injection (SKI) has been proposed as a solution: it integrates domain-specific expertise into Machine Learning (ML) models, to improve their predictive capabilities. Despite their promising results in other fields, applicability of SKI in healthcare scenarios has not been thoroughly investigated, yet. Accordingly, in this study, we explore the applicability of a SKI method on medical datasets to evaluate: (i) how the predictive capabilities of ML models changes, (ii) their adherence to the medical protocols, and (iii) their robustness w.r.t. data degradation. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating data-driven models with established medical guidelines by improving different clinically relevant metrics. },
