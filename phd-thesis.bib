  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter begins with a simple description language and reveals how a very small change in its expressiveness completely changes the sort of reasoning procedure it requires. It also considers the idea of languages in a more limited way than first-order logic (FOL) and examines what seems to happen as they are generalized to full FOL. To illustrate the tradeoff between expressiveness and tractability it begins by examining a very concrete case involving description logics and the subsumption task. It suggests that one way of dealing with the tradeoff is to allow very expressive languages, but to preserve tractability by doing a form of reasoning that is somehow less demanding. Researchers have proposed alternative logical systems with weaker notions of entailment that might be candidates for exploration of limited reasoning with expressive representation languages. The tradeoff between expressiveness and complexity is so fundamental to the understanding of knowledge representation and reasoning the chapter also concentrates on that issue and leaves aside the consideration of weak logics.}
