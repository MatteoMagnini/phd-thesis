In this chapter we present two main algorithmic contributions to the field of \gls{SKI}.
%
First, we provide the motivations behind the design and development of these contributions in \Cref{sec:ski-motivations}.
%
Second, we detail the contributions themselves in \Cref{sec:ski-contribution-kill,sec:ski-contribution-kins}, and we report the results of the empirical evaluation of these contributions.
%
Finally, we discuss the implications of these contributions and outline future directions in \Cref{sec:ski-discussion-and-future-direction}.


\section{Motivations}\label{sec:ski-motivations}
%
Aware by the limitations reported in \Cref{subsec:limitations-and-challenges-of-ski}, we wanted to develop novel \gls{SKI} methods that could be used in many different domains.
%
For this reason, these methods include all the elements described in \Cref{subsec:how-to-inject}.
%
In particular, a \emph{parser} is provided to convert symbolic knowledge into a format that can be injected into a neural network.
%
In this way, we are not bounded to a specific knowledge base nor to a specific domain.
%
The transformation of the parsed rules into a numeric interpretation is automatically performed by a \emph{fuzzification step}.
%
Finally, the sub-symbolic component is injected into a neural network, which is trained to learn the symbolic knowledge.

Another limitation that we wanted to address is the expressiveness of the symbolic knowledge that can be injected.
%
What we target in these two works is knowledge expressed in \emph{stratified Datalog with negation}.
