In this chapter, we present the \Gls{PSyKI} platform, which is a framework for \gls{SKI} methods.
%
\Gls{PSyKI} provides a unified way to implement \gls{SKI} methods, aiming to facilitate the development and comparison of different approaches.
%
It also provides a set of tools to evaluate the performance of \gls{SKI} methods, including metrics for measuring the quality of the injected knowledge and the performance of the resulting models.
%
In \Cref{sec:psyki}, we present the work ``\emph{On the Design of PSyKI: A Platform for Symbolic Knowledge Injection into Sub-symbolic Predictors}''~\cite{DBLP:conf/atal/MagniniCO22}, which describes the design and implementation of \gls{PSyKI}.
%
Then, in \Cref{sec:qos}, we present respectively two works that study the quality of service of \gls{SKI} methods:
%
in \Cref{subsec:ski-meets-intelligent-agents} the paper ``\emph{Symbolic Knowledge Injection Meets Intelligent Agents}''~\cite{DBLP:journals/aamas/AgiolloRMCO23},
%
which introduces metrics for evaluating the performance of \gls{SKI} methods in the context of intelligent agents,
%
and in \Cref{subsec:empirical-study-on-the-robustness-of-ski-methods} the paper ``\emph{An Empirical Study on the Robustness of Symbolic Knowledge Injection Techniques Against Data Degradation}''~\cite{DBLP:conf/woa/RafanelliMACO24},
%
which studies the robustness of \gls{SKI} methods against data degradation.


\section{PSyKI}\label{sec:psyki}
%
\Gls{PSyKI} is a (Python) platform for the development and evaluation of \gls{SKI} methods.
%
It is designed to provide a unified framework for implementing \gls{SKI} methods, allowing researchers and practitioners to easily develop, test, and compare different approaches.
%
In the following, we present a summary of the work ``\emph{On the Design of PSyKI: A Platform for Symbolic Knowledge Injection into Sub-symbolic Predictors}''~\cite{DBLP:conf/atal/MagniniCO22}, presented at the 4th International Workshop on EXplainable, Trustworthy, and Responsible AI and Multi-Agent Systems (EXTRAAMAS 2022)\footnote{\url{https://extraamas.ehealth.hevs.ch/archive.html}}.
%
The library is public available on GitLab and PyPi\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.com/psykei/psyki-python} and \url{https://pypi.org/project/psyki/}}.


\subsection{Motivations}\label{subsec:psyki-motivations}
%
This work is motivated by the need to address the common challenges that affect \gls{SKI} methods (see \Cref{subsec:limitations-and-challenges-of-ski}).
%
In particular, we want to address the following points:
%
\begin{inlinelist}
    \item \emph{lack of generality}, by providing the proper tools to automatically translate symbolic knowledge of arbitrary domains into a format suitable for injection into sub-symbolic predictors,
    %
    \item \emph{lack of reproducibility}, by providing a unified framework for implementing \gls{SKI} methods, allowing researchers to easily develop, test, and compare different approaches, and
    %
    \item \emph{lack of availability}, by encouraging the development of reusable software libraries for \gls{SKI} methods.
    %
\end{inlinelist}
%
Concerning the last point mentioned in \Cref{subsec:limitations-and-challenges-of-ski}, we identified in the logic language of stratified Datalog with negation a suitable candidate for the symbolic knowledge representation.
%
It is expressive enough to represent a wide range of symbolic knowledge, while being simple enough to be easily translated into a format suitable for injection into sub-symbolic predictors.


\subsection{Design and implementation}\label{subsec:design-and-implementation}

    }
    \label{fig:knowledge-workflow-psyki}
\end{figure}
%
All symbolic knowledge injection (\gls{SKI}) methods implemented in \gls{PSyKI} share a common transformation pipeline, illustrated in \Cref{fig:knowledge-workflow-psyki}.
%
Symbolic knowledge \(\phi\) cannot usually be injected directly into a sub-symbolic predictor.
%
Instead, it undergoes a two-step transformation:
%
\begin{inlinelist}
    %
    \item \emph{Parsing} (\(\Pi\)): the knowledge is converted into a visitable data structure, such as an \gls{AST} in the case of logic formulas, resulting in \(\phi'\);
    %
    \item \emph{Fuzzification} (\(\zeta\)): the parsed representation is transformed into a sub-symbolic form \(\phi''\), suitable for injection.
    %
\end{inlinelist}
%
Fuzzification plays a key role in bridging the symbolic and sub-symbolic domains.
%
It translates crisp Boolean logic into a form compatible with sub-symbolic models, often by relaxing discrete truth values into continuous-valued functions or generating neural components such as layers or entire \glspl{NN}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/psyki-workflow}
    \caption[General workflow of PSyKI]{

        The symbolic knowledge is transformed and injected into the sub-symbolic predictor, which is then trained on data.
    }
    \label{fig:psyki-workflow}
\end{figure}
%
\Cref{fig:psyki-workflow} shows the overall injection process in \gls{PSyKI}, including both the transformation of the symbolic knowledge and its integration into the learning system.
%
After the transformation phase, the different \gls{SKI} methods diverge:
%
\begin{inlinelist}
    %
    \item \emph{Structuring} and \emph{guided learning} inject \(\phi''\) directly into the architecture or training process of the predictor;
    %
    \item \emph{Embedding}-based methods use symbolic knowledge to enrich or generate the input data, so they are not directly represented in \Cref{fig:psyki-workflow}.
    %
\end{inlinelist}

\Gls{PSyKI} supports all three approaches, although it is primarily designed for \emph{structuring} and \emph{guided learning}, where the injection occurs directly into the predictor.
%
In general, \gls{SKI} algorithms operate on a predictor \(P\) and symbolic knowledge \(\phi\), producing a new predictor \(P'\) as output.
%
This modified predictor is then trained on data, resulting in a final model \(P''\), which can be reused in further iterations with different knowledge or injection strategies.


\paragraph{Architecture}\label{par:architecture}
%
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/class-diagram}
    \caption[Class diagram of PSyKI]{

        %
        The main components are the \emph{Injector}, the \emph{Formula} and the \emph{Fuzzifier}.
        %
        The package \emph{logic.datalog} is an examplification showing two \emph{Injector} implementations and their relationships.
    }
    \label{fig:psyki-class-diagram}
\end{figure}
%
Essentially, \gls{PSyKI} is designed around the notion of injector.
%
An injector is any algorithm accepting a \gls{ML} predictor and prior symbolic knowledge -- predominantly logic formulas -- as input that produces a new predictor as output.
%
In order to properly perform injection, injectors may require additional information such as algorithm specific hyperparameters.


\gls{PSyKI} supports the processing of symbolic knowledge represented via logic formulas.
%
Based on the sort of logic, user can build an \gls{AST} for each formula.
%
The \gls{AST} can be inspected through a fuzzifier via pattern visitor to encode the symbolic knowledge to a sub-symbolic form (e.g. fuzzy logic functions, ad-hoc layers).
%
The resulting sub-symbolic object can finally be used by an injector to create a new predictor.
%
This process -- denoted with $\zeta$ \Cref{fig:psyki-workflow} -- is injector specific; instead, the same parser $\Pi$ can be used for logic formulas of the same sort independently of the injector.


The software is organized into well-separated packages to ensure easy extensibility towards new sort of logic and fuzzifiers---see \Cref{fig:psyki-class-diagram}
%
An \gls{AST} is a \emph{formula} object, and it can have different language specific elements w.r.t. the logic form that is covered.
%
Each formula implementation is self-contained inside a standalone package so that if a user wants to add a new logic form it is sufficient to add its implementation in a new package.
%
Similarly, a fuzzifier object that targets a specific logic form can be added inside the same package of the logic, there can be any number of fuzzifiers for a given logic.


\paragraph{Details}\label{par:details}
%
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/grammar}
    \caption[Class diagram for the representation of Datalog formulas]{

    }
    \label{fig:grammar}
\end{figure}
%
A crucial point in the \gls{SKI} workflow is the embedding of knowledge from symbolic into sub-symbolic form.
%
Ideally, there is no constraint on the formalism used to represent the prior knowledge (e.g., logic formulas, knowledge graph).
%
The most common knowledge representation form that \gls{SKI} algorithms claim to support is \gls{FOL} or one of its subsets.
%
However, there are characteristics of \gls{FOL} that are not ideal for some predictors.
%
Recursion and function symbols -- that allow recursive structures -- cannot be easily integrated into a predictor that is acyclic -- i.e., no recursive -- by construction such as conventional \gls{NN} (virtually all \gls{NN}, with few exceptions like fibred \gls{NN}~\cite{DBLP:conf/flairs/BaderGH05}).
%
Conversely, in this work we consider one of the most general and expressive logic formalism that does not support recursion and function symbols: stratified Datalog with negation.


Stratified Datalog with negation has been already described in detail in \Cref{subsec:ski-stratified-datalog-with-negation}.
%
To support injection into a particular predictor, we further assume the input knowledge base defines at least one outer relation -- say output or class -- involving as many variables as the input and output features the predictor has been trained upon.
%
Such a relation may be defined via one or more clauses, and each clause may leverage on other predicates in their bodies.
%
In turn, each predicate may be defined through one or more clause.
%
In that case, since we rely on stratified Datalog, we require input knowledge to not include any (directly or indirectly) recursive clause definition.


Once that the logic has been formalized, the implementation of a Formula -- visitable data structure like an \gls{AST} -- is quite straightforward.
%
\Cref{fig:grammar} depicts the general API for representing logic formulas, as currently supported by \gls{PSyKI}.
%
To make \gls{PSyKI} able to parse bare text into actual logic formulas compliant to that API, we rely on well-established parser-generation facilities such as ANTLR~\cite{DBLP:journals/spe/ParrQ95}.
%
As further discussed below, the knowledge contained into a Formula object, can then be embedded in sub-symbolic form, via a fuzzifier, to be later injected into a predictor.
