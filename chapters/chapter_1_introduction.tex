\section{Research background and context}\label{sec:research-background-and-context}
%
Through the course of history, humanity has experienced several socio-technological revolutions that have changed the way we live.
%
From the first industrial revolution that initiated the automation of manual labor, to the world-wide spread of computers that started the automation of processes and decision-making \sidenote{cite/talk about expert systems(?)}, we are now witnessing the \ac{AI} revolution.
%
The advent of \ac{AI} has already successfully automated cognitive tasks \sidenote{add citation to image recognition and similar}, and it is expected to go further by reaching -- and possibly surpassing -- \emph{human-level intelligence}.
%
\Ac{AI} is not a recent invention, it has been around since the 1950s.
%
The reasons why only now (in the last decade to be more precise) \ac{AI} has become ubiquitous are the presence of crucial ingredients that were missing in the past.
%
Thanks to
%
\begin{inlinelist}
    \item the enormous amount of \emph{data},
    %
    \item the improvement of \emph{memory} and \emph{computational power} -- that still follows the Moore's law --, and
    %
    \item the affordability of huge quantity of \emph{energy},
    %
\end{inlinelist}
%
\ac{AI} finally flourished again.

The first kind of \ac{AI} that was developed is \emph{symbolic}.
%
Symbolic means that there are symbols with specific meanings that are manipulated by algorithms.
%
Symbolic \ac{AI} follows the \emph{deductive} process of reasoning, where the system starts from a set of axioms and applies rules.
%
These kinds of\ac{AI} programs are pretty effective in well-defined domains where there are clear rules that always hold, e.g., board games,~\ac{TSP},~\acp{BWP}, etc.
%
\emph{Sub-symbolic} \ac{AI} came after, and it is based on the \emph{inductive} process of reasoning.
%
Conversely to symbolic \ac{AI}, sub-symbolic \ac{AI} does not rely on symbols that have meanings for humans, but on patterns that are learned from data.
