\section{Overview}\label{sec:ai-overview}
%
The wide range of \gls{AI} techniques used to be divided into two main categories: \emph{symbolic} and \emph{sub-symbolic} \Gls{AI}.
%
The thing that distinguishes the two categories is the way they \emph{represent knowledge} and how they process it.
%
No intelligence can exist without knowledge and no computation can occur in lack of representation.
%
In the rest of the thesis, we will use the term symbolic (resp., sub-symbolic) \Gls{AI} and symbolic (resp., sub-symbolic) \Gls{KR} almost interchangeably.
%
Symbolic \Gls{AI} is based on \emph{symbols}, which come with a \emph{meaning} and could be manipulated according to the formalism and rules of a given \Gls{AI} system.
%
On the other hand, sub-symbolic \Gls{AI} is based on a numerical representation -- a.k.a., sub-symbolic -- where the numbers are not directly interpretable.
%
\todo{Talk more about the two systems in general}
%
In the following sections, we will explore symbolic and sub-symbolic \Gls{AI} in more detail.


\section{Symbolic \Gls{AI}}\label{sec:symbolic-ai}
%
Symbolic \Gls{AI} has been regarded as crucial since \Gls{AI}\'s inception.
%
Symbolic \Gls{KR} offers enhanced flexibility, expressiveness, and intelligibility, being interpretable both by machines and by humans.
%
Historically, most \Gls{KR} formalisms and their enabling technologies have been rooted in \Gls{CL}.
%
Increased expressiveness often comes at the cost of higher computational complexity, giving rise to the well-known \emph{expressiveness vs. tractability} trade-off~\cite{DBLP:conf/dlog/2003handbook}.
%
To balance these concerns, various fragments and extensions of \Gls{FOL} have been identified, each providing different tradeoffs between what can be expressed and what can be decided efficiently
