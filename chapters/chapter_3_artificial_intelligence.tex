\section{Overview}\label{sec:ai-overview}
%
The wide range of \gls{AI} techniques used to be divided into two main categories: \emph{symbolic} and \emph{sub-symbolic} \gls{AI}.
%
The thing that distinguishes the two categories is the way they \emph{represent knowledge} and how they process it.
%
No intelligence can exist without knowledge and no computation can occur in lack of representation.
%
In the rest of the thesis, we will use the term symbolic (resp., sub-symbolic) \gls{AI} and symbolic (resp., sub-symbolic) \gls{KR} almost interchangeably.
%
Symbolic \gls{AI} is based on \emph{symbols}, which come with a \emph{meaning} and could be manipulated according to the formalism and rules of a given \gls{AI} system.
%
On the other hand, sub-symbolic \gls{AI} is based on a numerical representation -- a.k.a., sub-symbolic -- where the numbers are not directly interpretable.
%
Numbers are technically symbols, but numbers, arrays and their functions are not recognised as means for symbolic \gls{KR}.
%
According to Van Gelder~\cite{DBLP:conf/ogai/Gelder90}, in order to be considered symbolic, \gls{KR} approaches must:
%
\begin{requirements}
    %
    \item \label{itm:symbolic-req-1} involve a set of symbols;
    %
    \item \label{itm:symbolic-req-2} the symbols can be combined following a set of grammatical rules;
    %
    \item \label{itm:symbolic-req-3} elementary symbols and combinations of symbols can be assigned a meaning.
    %
\end{requirements}


\paragraph{Local vs. distributed}
%
Multidimensional arrays are the fundamental building block of sub-symbolic data representation.
%
Formally, a $D$-order array is an ordered container of real numbers, where $D$ indicates the number of indices required to access each element.
%
We refer to 1-order arrays as \emph{vectors}, 2-order arrays as \emph{matrices}, and arrays of order greater than two as \emph{tensors}.
%
In sub-symbolic tasks based on arrays, information is typically conveyed both by the values stored in the array and their position within it.
%
The dimensions of the array -- denoted as $(d_1 \times \dots \times d_D)$ -- also play a crucial role, as sub-symbolic systems are usually designed to operate on arrays of fixed shape.
%
That is, the values of $d_1, \dots, d_D$ are chosen at design time and remain unchanged thereafter.
%
This violates \Cref{itm:symbolic-req-2} above; accordingly, we define sub-symbolic \gls{KR} as the task of encoding information into rigid numeric arrays.
%
\emph{Local} and \emph{distributed} representations are two key modes for encoding data into such arrays.
%
In local representations, each entry in the array corresponds to a well-defined concept from the target domain---its semantic meaning is clear and independent.
%
In distributed representations, by contrast, individual values carry little or no standalone meaning: their interpretation depends on the configuration of values across a neighbourhood in the indexing space.
%
Consequently, while the exact location of values is largely irrelevant in local representations, it becomes essential in distributed ones.
%
Notably, distributed representations violate \Cref{itm:symbolic-req-3}, and for this reason, recent literature often labels as \emph{sub-symbolic} those predictors that rely on distributed encoding of data.


\section{Symbolic \Gls{AI}}\label{sec:symbolic-ai}
%
Symbolic \gls{AI} has been regarded as crucial since \gls{AI}'s inception.
%
Symbolic \gls{KR} offers enhanced flexibility, expressiveness, and intelligibility, being interpretable both by machines and by humans.

\paragraph{Intentional vs. extensional}
%
In formal logic, one may define concepts either \emph{extensionally} or \emph{intensionally}.
%
Extensional definitions are direct representations of data.
%
For example, the set of square numbers admits the extensional definition $\{0,1,4,9,16,\dots\}$ by listing every member explicitly.
%
Conversely, an \emph{intensional} definition is an indirect representation of data.
%
In \gls{FOL}, this corresponds to defining a relation via a formula; for instance, the set of square numbers can be defined as $\{\,x\mid \exists n\in\mathbb{Z}\,(x = n^2)\}$ which succinctly encodes an infinite extension with a single schema.
%
Recursive intensional predicates further enhance expressivity: for example, the ancestor relation can be axiomatized by $\mathit{Ancestor}(x,y)\;\Leftrightarrow\;\mathit{Parent}(x,y)\;\lor\;\exists z\,[\,\mathit{Parent}(x,z)\wedge\mathit{Ancestor}(z,y)\,]$ allowing a compact representation of an infinite set of pairs with a finite rule.
%
In formal logic, intensional definitions are prized for their ability to model potentially unbounded domains within finite logical formalisms.


\paragraph{Expressiveness vs. tractability}
%
Tractability addresses the theoretical question of whether a logic reasoner can determine the truth of a given formula within feasible time and space bounds.
%
The answer is deeply tied to the specific reasoning algorithm and the logic's formal properties.
%
Depending on the features a logic provides -- such as quantifiers, function symbols, or recursive definitions -- it may be more or less expressive.
%
The higher the expressiveness, the more complex the problems that can be represented and reasoned about, but this also increases the computational burden.
%
This well-known phenomenon is often referred to as the expressiveness/tractability trade-off~\cite{DBLP:journals/jlp/CadoliS93,BRACHMAN2004327,DBLP:journals/ci/LevesqueB87}.
%
In practice, highly expressive logics make it easier for human users to model rich domains, often requiring fewer and more concise formulas.
%
However, this comes at the cost of automated inference, which may become computationally intractable, undecidable, or non-terminating in the general case.
%
To mitigate this issue, various fragments and extensions of \gls{FOL} have been identified, each providing different tradeoffs between what can be expressed and what can be decided efficiently.


\subsection{\Glsentrylong{FOL}}\label{subsec:first-order-logic}
%
\Gls{FOL} is a general-purpose formalism that underpins most symbolic \gls{KR} systems.
%
It enables both human and computational agents to model entities and their interrelations through predicates and terms within a defined domain of discourse.
%
Its syntax comprises variables (quantified explicitly or implicitly), constants, function symbols, and predicate symbols, which are combined via logical operators such as conjunction (\(\wedge\)), disjunction (\(\vee\)), implication (\(\rightarrow\)), and equivalence (\(\leftrightarrow\)).
%
\Gls{FOL} allows for both \emph{extensional} and \emph{intensional} definitions.
%
Recursive intensional definitions, in particular, are powerful, enabling finite representations of infinite sets.
%
Despite its flexibility, \gls{FOL} is semi-decidable in general: there is no algorithm that can determine the truth of every \gls{FOL} formula in finite time, which limits its use in systems requiring guaranteed termination~\cite{DBLP:conf/dlog/2003handbook}.


\subsection{Horn logic}\label{subsec:horn-logic}
%
Horn logic is a significant subset of \gls{FOL}, offering a balanced trade-off between theoretical expressiveness and practical tractability~\cite{DBLP:journals/jcss/Makowsky87}.
%
It is built around the concept of \emph{Horn clauses}~\cite{DBLP:journals/jsyml/Horn51}, which are formulas in \gls{FOL} that exclude quantifiers and consist of a disjunction of predicates, with at most one non-negated literal.
%
Alternatively, a Horn clause can be expressed as an implication where the consequent is a single predicate and the antecedent is a conjunction of predicates: \(h \gets b_1, \dots, b_n\).
%
Here, \(\gets\) denotes logical implication (from right to left), commas represent logical conjunctions, and \(b_i\) as well as \(h\) are predicates of arbitrary arity, potentially containing \gls{FOL} terms such as variables, constants, or functions.

Horn clauses can be interpreted as \emph{if-then} rules written in reverse order, where only conjunctions of predicates are allowed in the antecedent.
%
In essence, Horn logic is a constrained subset of \gls{FOL} characterized by the following limitations:
%
\begin{inlinelist}
%
    \item formulas are reduced to clauses, containing only predicates, conjunctions, and a single implication operator;
    %
    \item operators such as \(\lor\), \(\leftrightarrow\), or \(\neg\) (negation) are not allowed;
    %
    \item variables are implicitly quantified; and
    %
    \item terms behave as they do in \gls{FOL}.
    %
\end{inlinelist}


\subsection{Datalog}\label{subsec:datalog}
%
Datalog is a declarative query language and a restricted subset of \gls{FOL}, designed for deductive databases and knowledge representation~\cite{DBLP:journals/jcss/AjtaiG94}.
%
It represents knowledge using function-free Horn clauses, as defined in \Cref{subsec:horn-logic}.
%
This restriction eliminates the use of function symbols, thereby forbidding structured terms such as recursive data structures.
%
As a result, Datalog is well-suited for applications requiring finite and decidable reasoning, as the absence of function symbols ensures termination of inference algorithms.
%
Similar to Horn logic, Datalogâ€™s knowledge bases consist of sets of function-free Horn clauses, which are interpreted as rules and facts.
%
Rules in Datalog follow the form \(h \gets b_1, \dots, b_n\), where \(h\) is the head of the rule and \(b_1, \dots, b_n\) are the body predicates.
%
Unlike general \gls{FOL}, Datalog does not allow disjunctions, negations, or explicit quantifiers, as variables are implicitly universally quantified.
%
Datalog is widely used in areas such as \glspl{KG}, semantic web technologies, and database systems, where efficient reasoning over large datasets is required.
%
Its simplicity and computational efficiency make it a practical choice for symbolic \gls{AI} tasks that demand tractable reasoning.


\subsection{\Glsentrylong{DL}}\label{subsec:dl}
%
\Gls{DL} are a family of subsets of \gls{FOL}, typically involving limited or no quantifiers, no structured terms, and no \textit{n}-ary predicates where \(n \geq 3\)~\cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0041477}.
%
In essence, \gls{DL} represents knowledge using constants and variables, along with atomic, unary, and binary predicates.


The differences among specific variants of \gls{DL} lie in the set of supported logical connectives and whether negation is allowed.
%
The wide variety of \gls{DL} stems from the well-known trade-off between expressiveness and tractability.
%
Depending on the application, one may prefer a more expressive \gls{DL} variant, which offers richer features at the cost of reduced tractability or even decidability of algorithms manipulating the knowledge, or vice versa.


In \gls{DL}, it is common practice to use specific terminology for different elements of knowledge representation:
%
\begin{itemize}
    %
    \item Constant terms are referred to as \textit{individuals}, as each constant represents a single entity within a domain.
    %
    \item Unary predicates are called \textit{classes} or \textit{concepts}, grouping sets of individuals for which the predicate holds true.
    %
    \item Binary predicates are referred to as \textit{properties} or \textit{roles}, connecting pairs of individuals.
    %
\end{itemize}
%

Using this nomenclature, knowledge in \gls{DL} can be represented by associating entities with constants (e.g., URLs) and defining concepts and properties accordingly.
%
Binary predicates are particularly significant as they enable the connection of pairs of entities.
%
This is typically achieved through subjectâ€“predicateâ€“object triplets, represented as ground binary predicates of the form \(\langle a \, f \, b\rangle\) or \(f(a, b)\), where \(a\) is the subject, \(f\) is the predicate, and \(b\) is the object.

Collections of such triplets form \glspl{KG}, which are directed graphs where vertices represent individuals and arcs represent binary properties connecting these individuals.
%
\glspl{KG} may explicitly or implicitly instantiate a specific ontology, which is a formal description of classes characterizing a domain, their relationships (e.g., inclusion, exclusion, intersection, equivalence), and the properties they must or must not include.


\glspl{DL} are widely used in applications such as semantic web~\cite{DBLP:conf/coopis/GangemiM03} and ontology engineering~\cite{DBLP:books/ios/HGJKP2016}, where efficient reasoning and knowledge representation are essential.
%
Their ability to balance expressiveness and computational efficiency makes them a cornerstone of symbolic reasoning systems.


\subsection{Ontologies and \glsentrylong{KG}}\label{subsec:ontologies-and-kg}
%
An ontology is a formal and explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation of a domain~\cite{DBLP:books/daglib/p/Grimm10}.
%
It provides a structured vocabulary to describe the entities relevant in that domain, along with their attributes and the relationships among them.
%
This organisation enables both human understanding and machine-based reasoning.

Ontologies are typically expressed using \glspl{DL}, a family of logic-based formalisms for knowledge representation.
%
\Glspl{DL} define three main components:
%
\begin{inlinelist}
    %
    \item\emph{concepts} (or \emph{classes}), which group entities sharing similar features;
    %
    \item\emph{individuals} (or \emph{instances}), which are the concrete elements of the domain;
    %
    \item\emph{roles} (or \emph{properties}), which describe binary relationships between individuals.
    %
\end{inlinelist}
%
Different \glspl{DL} vary in their expressive power: for example, \gls{EL} supports only conjunction and existential quantification to ensure efficient reasoning, while more expressive DLs like \gls{ALC} allow for full Boolean operators and universal quantification.

Concepts are typically denoted using capital italic letters, such as $\mathit{Animal}$ or $\mathit{Cat}$.
%
These can be combined using logical constructors like intersection ($\sqcap$), union ($\sqcup$), or negation ($\lnot$) to form more complex classes.
%
A statement like $\mathit{Cat} \sqsubseteq \mathit{Animal}$ expresses that all cats are animals.

Individuals are constants representing specific entities in the domain and are usually written in monospaced lowercase, for example \texttt{tom}.
%
Membership of an individual in a concept is denoted using the ``is-a'' relation, written as \texttt{tom}~:~$\mathit{Cat}$, meaning ``Tom is a cat.''
%
Each individual may belong to multiple concepts.

Roles represent binary relations between individuals and are written in lowercase sans-serif font, such as \textsf{eats}.
%
They connect pairs of individuals, and their domain and range can be restricted using expressions such as $\textsf{eats} \sqsubseteq \mathit{Animal} \times \mathit{Edible}$.
%
Assertions like $\textsf{eats}(\texttt{tom}, \texttt{mouse})$ state that Tom eats the mouse.

The subsumption relation ($\sqsubseteq$) is used to express inclusion between concepts or roles.
%
For instance, $\mathit{Cat} \sqsubseteq \mathit{Animal}$ means that every cat is also an animal, and $\textsf{predatorOf} \sqsubseteq \textsf{eats}$ means that every predator-prey relationship implies eating.
%
Special concepts such as $\top$ and $\bot$ are used to denote the most general and the most specific concepts, respectively.

Collections of such axioms form an ontology.
%
\Gls{TBOX} define concepts and roles and their interrelations, while \gls{ABOX} specify which individuals belong to which concepts or are related via which roles.

\Glspl{KG} also provide a structured way to represent knowledge as graphs.
%
They consist of triplets (or \emph{facts}) of the form $(s, p, o)$, where $s$ is the subject, $p$ is the predicate (or property), and $o$ is the object.
%
These triplets form a directed graph where nodes represent individuals and edges represent relationships.

Unlike ontologies, KGs do not necessarily impose formal constraints on the structure or semantics of the triplets.
%
This flexibility allows for representing heterogeneous and incomplete data.
%
However, some \glspl{KG} are explicitly grounded in an ontology, and may follow its vocabulary and logical constraints.

In summary, ontologies and knowledge graphs both aim to formally capture structured knowledge.
%
Ontologies provide formal semantics and enable logical reasoning, while knowledge graphs emphasise scalability and flexibility in representing factual data.
