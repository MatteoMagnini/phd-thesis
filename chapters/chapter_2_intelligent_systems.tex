\section{What is intelligence?}\label{sec:what-is-intelligence}

Intelligence is a concept that encompasses a wide range of abilities and characteristics of single \emph{individuals} or \emph{groups}.
%
From an \emph{evolutionary} perspective, intelligence characterises some animal species -- and organisms belonging to other biological kingdoms -- from simple forms of life.
%
In the history of our planet, carbon-based life evolved from unicellular organisms to multicellular organisms, and ultimately to complex organisms with specialized cells and tissues.
%
Some of these organisms (e.g., insects) developed skills -- such as \emph{navigation}, \emph{communication}, \emph{self-organisation}, \emph{adaptation}, and so on -- that \emph{are perceived} as intelligent abilities.
%
More evolved individuals (e.g., mammals) developed even more complex forms of intelligence, such as \emph{planning}, \emph{reasoning}, \emph{learning}, etc.


In much more recent history, the carbon-based life was not the only one to ``manifest'' intelligent behaviours.
%
With the invention of the computer, also machines can perform tasks that we consider intelligent.
%
To distinguish between the intelligence of living beings and that of machines, we refer to the former as \emph{natural intelligence} and to the latter as \emph{\gls{AI}}.


Intelligence originally emerged as a result of the evolutionary process and from the interaction of organisms with each others and their environment.
%
Later, we built machines that can perform tasks that require some sort of intelligent ability.
%
However, it is us -- as humans -- \emph{to attribute} the label of intelligent to someone or something and not to others.
%
Indeed, it is said that \emph{``intelligence is in the eye of the beholder''}.
%
In this sense, we can say that intelligence is not an absolute concept, but it should be considered under a relative perspective.


Giving a rigorous definition of intelligence is not a trivial task.
%
Furthermore, there is not one single shape of intelligence, but it can be declined in many different ways (e.g., \emph{emotional intelligence}, \emph{social intelligence}, \emph{spatial intelligence}, etc.).
%
In this thesis we do not stay strictly to a specific definition of intelligence, nevertheless we give a broad definition to help the reader to get more familiar some concepts that will be introduced later.
%
We adopt a definition inspired by a notorious satirical essay by Carlo Cipolla~\cite{cipolla2013allegro}.
%
In \emph{``The basic laws of human stupidity''}, the author classifies individuals into four categories based on the result of their actions:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stupid} $\rightarrow$ losses for others and for themselves;
    \item \textbf{Helpless} $\rightarrow$ benefits for others and losses for themselves;
    \item \textbf{Bandit} $\rightarrow$ losses for others and benefits for themselves;
    \item \textbf{Intelligent} $\rightarrow$ benefits for others and for themselves.
\end{itemize}
%
Now, what is a \emph{loss} or a \emph{benefit}?
%
We can see losses and benefits as the failure or success in -- fully or partially -- achieving a certain \emph{goal}.
%
With this respect we can state that:
%
\begin{definition}[Intelligent behaviour]
    \label{def:intelligence}
    an individual (or a group) has an intelligent behaviour if it is able to \textbf{perform actions} that lead to the \textbf{achievement} of a given \textbf{goal}.
\end{definition}


In this chapter, we briefly talk about intelligence in animals and humans (\Cref{subsec:intelligence-in-animals,subsec:intelligence-in-humans}).
%
Then, we introduce \gls{AI} and its most relevant subfields (\Cref{sec:intelligence-in-computer-science}).
%
Finally, we focus on the core topic of this thesis: \emph{learning} and \emph{autonomous learning} (\Cref{sec:learning,sec:autonomous-learning}).


\subsection{Intelligence in animals}\label{subsec:intelligence-in-animals}

In order to survive in their environment, animals -- but also other organisms of different kingdoms such as plants or fungi -- have developed a set of abilities and some of them are perceived as intelligent.
%
For the sake of simplicity, we will consider just to animals, but many of the concepts we will talk about can be extended to other organisms.
%
Animals have a \emph{body}, and they are \emph{situated} in the physical world.
%
Through sensory organs, they can \emph{perceive} the environment and with muscles they can \emph{interact} with it.
%
They are \emph{autonomous} individuals, i.e., they are able to perform actions without the need of an external controller.


All animals are able to keep themselves alive (\emph{self-sufficiency}) until natural death or an accident occurs.
%
In addition to self-sufficiency, animals contribute to the survival of their species generating offspring.
%
To do so, they need to navigate the environment, find food, avoid predators, reproduce, and so on.
%
\note{TODO: add more and also examples}


\subsection{Intelligence in humans}\label{subsec:intelligence-in-humans}

Humans have \emph{reasoning} capabilities that no other animal can match.
%
\note{TODO: talk about reasoning. Deductive vs inductive reasoning. Learning. Social animals and share of knowledge.}

\section{Intelligence in computer science}\label{sec:intelligence-in-computer-science}

Since the automation of computation with the invention of the computer, intelligence has always been a central topic in computer science.
%
Officially, the field of \gls{AI} was born in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, where a group of researchers gathered to discuss the possibility of \emph{computing towards intelligence}.
%
In this section, we present how machines can perform intelligent tasks like the ones mentioned in \Cref{subsec:intelligence-in-animals,subsec:intelligence-in-humans} from an agent-based perspective.
%

\subsection{Agents}\label{subsec:agents}
%
We will use the term software \emph{agent} (just \emph{agent} for simplicity) from now on to refer to a software process that has particular characteristics.
%
One of these is \emph{autonomy}.
%
Autonomy is the ability of an agent to act without the direct control of humans or other agents.
%
Technically speaking, an agent encapsulates its own thread of control.
%
Autonomy is not absolute, but it is a matter of degree; e.g., self-sufficiency increases the degree of autonomy of an agent.
%
Autonomy -- \emph{per se} -- does not imply intelligence.
%
For example, from a biological perspective, a cell has some degree of autonomy (e.g., it has boundaries, it interacts with the environment, etc.), but certainly we do not consider it an intelligent entity.
%
However, it is a fundamental trait of living systems and life evolved towards more and more autonomous systems.


A \emph{robot} -- i.e., an \emph{embodied agent} -- that is able to recognise when its battery is low and to recharge itself is more autonomous than a robot that needs to be recharged by a human.

\section{Learning}\label{sec:learning}

Learning is the process that more than any other is perceived as part of intelligence.
%
Machines can learn in many different ways, like humans and animals do.
