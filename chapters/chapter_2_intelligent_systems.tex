\section{What is intelligence?}\label{sec:what-is-intelligence}

Intelligence is a concept that encompasses a wide range of abilities and characteristics of single \emph{individuals} or \emph{groups}.
%
From an \emph{evolutionary} perspective, intelligence characterises some animal species -- and organisms belonging to other biological kingdoms -- from simple forms of life.
%
In the history of our planet, carbon life evolved from unicellular organisms to multicellular organisms, and ultimately to complex organisms with specialized cells and tissues.
%
Some of these organisms (e.g., insects) developed abilities -- such as \emph{navigation}, \emph{communication}, \emph{self-organisation}, \emph{adaptation}, and so on -- that \emph{are recognised} as being part of some sort of intelligence.
%
More evolved individuals (e.g., mammals) developed even more complex forms of intelligence, such as \emph{planning}, \emph{reasoning}, \emph{learning}, etc.
