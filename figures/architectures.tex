            The agent is equipped with a set of \gls{SKE} and \gls{SKI} methods to manipulate knowledge, functions to pre/post-process knowledge, plus a task space and relatedness functions to evaluate if two different tasks are related.
            %
            Each task in the task space $T$ is paired with its specific knowledge. For each task the agent has at least one predictor.

            In the example are represented the knowledge of four tasks but they can come in arbitrary number.}
